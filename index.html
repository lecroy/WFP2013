                                    <p>
                                    The United Nations World Food Programme (WFP) is the world’s largest humanitarian agency fighting hunger across the globe. From rural villages in Ecuador to the slums of central Africa, WFP is on the ground reaching more than TK# million people in more than TK# countries each year, crossing the planet’s toughest terrain to bring relief to hungry people when it’s needed most. On any given day, an average of 50 planes, 30 ships and 5,000 trucks are delivering the agency’s life-saving aid to communities across the world. 
                                    </p>
                            </div>

                                <h1>In 2013, WFP provided more than half of the world’s food assistance.</h1>
                                    <p>
                                    But food is just the beginning. Beyond easing urgent hunger, WFP uses food to drive social and economic development. With the help of WFP USA and supporters like you, investments in areas like nutrition, education, women’s empowerment and agriculture help break the cycle of hunger and poverty for future generations. When healthy, educated people succeed and direct resources back to their families, sustainable solutions can take root.

                                <h1>A Message From World Food Program USA </h1>
                                    <p>
                                    When Typhoon Haiyan slammed into the Philippines on November 8, 2013, the world united to help survivors recover from one of the worst storms on record. In its wake, the typhoon left more than 4 million people without food or shelter— twice the number of people displaced by the 2004 Indian Ocean tsunami or the 2010 Haiti earthquake.<br><br>
 
                                    Within hours of the disaster, millions of people around the world stepped up to contribute to the relief effort. Tens of thousands of Americans reached into their own pockets to help families across the globe. American troops on the ground worked hand-in-glove with the Philippines government to clear rubble from major roadways and re-open airports so aid could be delivered. Corporate partners like UPS began mobilizing personnel and providing equipment so the World Food Programme could begin distributing food and setting up telecommunications systems in its role as the United Nations’ logistics arm. Restaurant chain YUM! Brands organized a campaign among its restaurant franchises to raise money. Major celebrities like Glee star Darren Criss rallied their fans on social media. Lawmakers like Rep. Jim McGovern urged their constituents to lend whatever support they could to those in need.<br><br>
 
                                    After the typhoon swept through the city of Tacloban, local survivors scrawled "PLEASE HELP" on slabs of debris. By the time we arrived one month later, the handmade signs read simply: "Thank you."<br><br>
 
                                    The response to Typhoon Haiyan showed us what the world can accomplish when we work together. Big and small, everyone played a part and each contribution made an impact.<br><br>
                                     
                                    But we must remember that hunger exists outside of natural disasters. Chronic hunger is a silent emergency. Every day, families all over the world are struggling to feed themselves and their children. Each year, hunger kills more people than AIDS, malaria, and tuberculosis combined. <br><br>

                                    But it doesn’t have to be this way. Hunger is solvable. <br><br>

                                    This year’s report will examine WFP’s worldwide impact through a global prism of personal experiences, from the individual donor in Oregon raising money for school meals to the pupil in Kenya who receives them; from the farmer in Mali who benefits from better agricultural training to the lawmaker who supported funding to make that training possible; from the typhoon survivor in the Philippines to the corporate leader whose company provided the supplies needed to rebuild that survivor’s community. <br><br>

                                    Through their commitment, WFP USA supporters improve lives across the globe. Without the generosity of so many individuals, schools, corporations, foundations and other organizations, this progress wouldn’t be possible. To those who stand with us to solve hunger, we offer our deepest thanks. <br><br>

                                    WFP USA will be here for as long as it takes to end global hunger. <br><br>

                                    We hope we can count on you to be there with us.<br><br>

                                    Sincerely,  <br><br>

                                The humanitarian crisis in Syria has become WFP’s largest and most complex emergency worldwide.  The country’s ongoing violence has displaced more than a third of the population—nearly 7 million Syrians and counting. 

                                But WFP has been on the ground since the crisis began. In partnership with the Syrian Arab Red Crescent and 23 other local organizations on the ground, WFP provided monthly food assistance to nearly TK million Syrians last year by dispatching over 700 trucks to deliver food and other relief items for the humanitarian community.  In addition to distributing staples like wheat flour, bulgur, lentils and canned goods, WFP provided specialized nutrition products to Syrian mothers and children. 

                                Outside Syria, WFP assisted nearly TKMILLION refugees in Iraq, Jordan, Lebanon, Egypt and Turkey last year, mostly through an innovative electronic voucher system—made possible with technical support from MasterCard—that was introduced last year. E-vouchers provide access to fresh produce and boost local economies, in addition to saving time and money on shipping costs. [LINK TO SYRIAN REFUGEE CASE STUDY]

                                    The Philippines relief effort began even before Typhoon Haiyan struck in November 2013, destroying the homes of more than 4 million people—twice the number displaced by the 2004 Indian Ocean tsunami or the 2010 Haiti earthquake.<br><br>
                                    By pre-positioning food supplies, WFP was able to launch its emergency operation within hours of the historic storm. In the first month after the typhoon alone, WFP reached more than 1 million survivors with life-saving food assistance, including food staples and High-Energy Biscuits, as well as providing critical infrastructure support. The agency later introduced a cash assistance program for more once markets had re-opened. [LINK TO PHILIPPINES SURVIVOR CASE STUDY]

                                <p>
                                    The Central African Republic (CAR) faces a steadily worsening hunger crisis. As well as the violence which has driven hundreds of thousands of people from their homes, the country's economy has almost collapsed. The majority of the Muslim trading community has fled, resulting in the near collapse of the country’s economic fabric. The national crisis quickly devolved into a regional catastrophe as thousands of families poured across CAR's borders into neighboring countries.<br><br>
 
                                    Inside CAR, people initially settled at makeshift camps, many near the airport in the capital of Bangui. The ongoing crisis has been exacerbated by bad sanitation in these sites, the lack of seeds for farmers to plant, rising food prices and the rainy season, which complicated relief efforts.<br><br>

                                    Even before the conflict, widespread hunger plagued the country, which has struggled for the past three decades to provide basic social and economic infrastructure due to ongoing rebellions, coups and fighting. Despite its wealth in mineral and natural resources, CAR ranks 180 out of 187 countries in the 2012 UNDP Human Development Index.

                                    Last year, violence in the world’s newest nation pushed millions of people into hunger, even in parts of the country not directly affected by fighting due to the disruption of trade routes and food markets. <br><br>
    
                                    Together with its humanitarian partners, WFP provided food to more than TKNUMBER people last year, many of whom sought refuge in UN compounds across the country. Despite security risks, WFP maintained its presence in the field while staffers on the ground worked to reach families in more remote locations.  The organization also assisted tens of thousands of people who fled across South Sudan’s borders into neighboring countries like Uganda.
